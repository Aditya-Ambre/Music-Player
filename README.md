# Music Player

**_This Project is a Music Player UserInterface based Web Application_**

**_What does it work?_**

1. Like any other music player we have 3 basic control buttons

   - **Play/Pause Button** it pauses/plays the current track/song
   - **Next Song Button** it starts playing the next song in queue.
   - **Previous Song Button** it starts playing the previous song in the queue.

2. All the songs details are stored into an array which is used to determine which song is playing, what to play next and which was the previous track.
3. We load song data like Thumbnail and Title of the track.
4. For the progress bar we compute the current time and duration of the audio with which we update the progress bar.
